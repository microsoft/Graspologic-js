# graspologic-js

## 📄Overview

**graspologic-js** is a high-performance graph toolkit for the web.

### Features

- A fast, memory-efficient, graph renderer.
  - **WebGL** based engine that can handle hundreds of thousands or even millions of nodes.
  - Utilizes **SharedArrayBuffer** for efficient and fast memory storage that can be shared between the UI thread and Web Workers, allowing for blazing fast layout algorithms that display output in real-time.
  - Supports [**ReactJS**](https://reactjs.org/) or standalone.
- Contains experimental implementations of a few popular graph layout algorithms that work directly with the graph renderer.

**graspologic-js** is a companion library to [**graspologic**](https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic), which is a python library for intelligently building networks and network embeddings, and for analyzing connected data.

## 🌐Browser Compatibility

Any browser which supports WebGL2. To see which browsers support WebGL2, please see [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl2)

It is recommended that you use a JavaScript bundling tool, such as Webpack or Browserify, as **graspologic-js** only exports CommonJS and ECMAScript module formats. It does not provide a web-friendly bundle in order to allow bundling tools to use tree-shaking to minimize dependency size.

It is also recommended that your bundler targets the following browser versions in order to minimize the amount of polyfills, which can adversely affect performance:

- Edge 79+
- Firefox 60+
- Chrome 72+

## 🔥 2 Minute Quick Start

### React

Install the `@graspologic/react` dependency

```sh
npm install @graspologic/react
```

Add the GraphView component to your app

```js
import React, { useMemo } from 'react'
import { GraphView } from '@graspologic/react'
export default () => {
	const data = useMemo(
		() => ({
			// Pass in your data here
			nodes: [],
			edges: [],
		}),
		[],
	)
	return <GraphView style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%' }} data={data} />
}
```

### Standalone

Install the `@graspologic/renderer` dependency

```sh
npm install @graspologic/renderer
```

```js
import { WebGLGraphRenderer } from '@graspologic/renderer'
import { GraphContainer } from '@graspologic/graph'

function createRenderer(width, height) {
	// Create a renderer and add it to the container
	const renderer = WebGLGraphRenderer.createInstance({
		width,
		height,
	})

	// Load the dataset
	renderer.load(
		GraphContainer.intern({
			// Pass in your data here
			nodes: [],
			edges: [],
		}),
	)

	// Start rendering
	renderer.start()

	// Return the container
	return renderer
}

// ...elsewhere in your app

// Instantiate the renderer
const renderer = createRenderer(500, 500)

// Add the renderer's canvas to your container element
containerElement.appendChild(renderer.view)
```
